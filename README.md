# Quiz Sample React+Redux Interface

## Running the project

In the project directory, you can run the project using predefined scripts:

```
REACT_APP_QUIZ_API=<quiz api url> npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. In this case environment variables must be passed directly on the command line or using `.env` file.

To run the project for production mode can use the script:

```
REACT_APP_QUIZ_API=<quiz api url> npm run build
```

Also in this case must provide the environment variable.
